I'm Mert—a London-based indie app developer who's mastered the art of starting ambitious projects and actually shipping them (most of the time). With a decade of iOS development experience and a background in HCI, I've learned that "perfect code" is just procrastination with syntax highlighting.

These days I'm building meditation apps and occasionally tinkering with hardware prototypes.
