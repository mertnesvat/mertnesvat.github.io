Hi👋🏻 I'm [@mertnesvat](https://twitter.com/mertnesvat). I grow up with open source culture and participated some of the open source libraries.

This year 2020, I put myself a goal of doing projects that people like. Even so much they would be willing to pay 🧘‍♂️

Let's see if I'll be able to do it!

This will be my journal to log my attempts. I'll try to write daily and be honest as much as possible 🤞
