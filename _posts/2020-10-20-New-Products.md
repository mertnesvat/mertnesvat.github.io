Going from Idea's selecting you mentality it becomes less and less painful to get rid of features. Currently I sent 3 apps to review in just a 3 weeks they were kind of unfinished and crawling on my famous developer folder but with lots of shame I sent them all to appstore. That's the reason I did a pause to Lingo project for now. Two of them are already published nothing major for marketting yet so almost a 10 visitors so far but adding more features.

I realised something interesting with this pet projects it's like a hack for procrastination. I get bored very easily with the ideas projects etc. so that's why I'm switching to different project and continue with one rule ship it and then change the focus. So far so good I was loyal to my shipping worst case I skipped some of the features which might take more time or I felt stupid to find a good solution for now. Like Elon says some problems should solve themselves with this inovation rate. ðŸ˜‚

Some information and screenshots from the current shipped apps. ðŸ‘‡
