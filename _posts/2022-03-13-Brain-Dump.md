## What is common in notebook of Da Vinci, Einstein, Marcus Aurelius?

It's very strange to think we are even now cyborg because of our phones and gadgets. It's at the end symbiotic lifestyle and we leave lots of our trace in our gadgets. It's also true for the notebooks imagine all interesting people have left some part of them to us with their notebooks. 

Books, biographies, inventions are not even close because they are the end goal and as soon as it serves to one purpose it becomes another entity. For example you might write great book about magnets but book serves to give information about magnets, what about your notebook in the process of writing or researching magnets, gives so much clue about your feelings, emotions, wonders. 

So what does all the notebooks which was written by interesting people have in common, they have trace of their thinking models of the owner. 

And to me the way these interesting people think is more valuable then what they produced. Because if we can think the way they think we might have different angles to the problems we are facing. 

It's maybe obvious for some people but for me I just recently realised interesting point from Einsteins notebook is that he approaches science as an art in some places and sometimes personalise scientific items as if they have characters and emotions.

Since I'm a software developer it was interesting idea to apply it to the code I wrote even in the commit massages which turned out to be fun activity. I have now many shy classes who knows the boundaries and thinks about his purpose in life(cycle) ( loose coupled )
