Just five minutes ago I sent the app I was working on for exactly a month. I changed design logo name three times before publishing it ðŸ˜„ I am such a amateur. But who cares I'm currently happy with it because I gave the name of my friend Yang! who is a canary ðŸ˜‚

Here he helps to me!

Yes I might be little effected from this social distancing self quarantine bla bla!

If we talk about the app I kept old designs here's  the revolution

I'll talk more  about what's the main goal of the app and why it's built. For now let's hope that it passes the app-store review.
