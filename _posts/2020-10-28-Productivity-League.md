Simply you register and match with your fellow maker and then start explaining what you are working on. At the end of the week review what went good or what went wrong and get the points accordingly. Week by week you built a trust and make this process more fun as a friend. 

Why this idea! 

Obviously I have a problem of keeping promises to my side projects or ideas that trusted in me which can help to humanity.
That is the main reason I'm trying to write. 

But there are other ways. Since we are social species there's a huge place of TRUST in our lives. Some people would kill themselves instead of harming this trust. Especially asian culture they're not doing harakiri for nothing. 

So if we share our ideas and plans with someone like minded we might click and start trusting each other.  It's same as interest group but in this case it's more oriented towards goals and keeping you accountable. I tried to find this kind of system but closest I could find was like a blind date where you change the makers all the time. 

Current version of the MVP is very experimental but let's see. Like Reid Hoffman says 
_"If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late."_
