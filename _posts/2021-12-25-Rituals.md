title: Why do we put our hands together when we pray? 🙏 🤲 
---
Religious ceremonies are the archaeological artefacts of the old habits. Not just a praying hand style, but some rituals are very hard yet survived as they integrated well into the stories we love and tell. It's fascinating to think some people did the same things over 2000 years, generation to generation, like baptism. It's effortless to believe that you are purified if hundred people say so. And, of course, a convincing story is always there.

Yes, our giant prediction machine called the brain loves stories. But still, it's not enough for it to integrate one ritual because it's in the story. There's a belief and construction of this belief by others. Affirmations. 

Keep doing what you're doing!
